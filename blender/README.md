# Introduction
Here are the 3D-printed parts of the watchdog, based on the marvellous [Wallace and Gromit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1852021) model from [reddadsteve](https://www.thingiverse.com/reddadsteve/designs) on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/).  As with the original, all parts are designed to be printed on an FDM printer such as the [Prusa MK4S](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mk4s-3d-printer-5/), though the parts here are three times larger and rather more complex given the mechanisation.

# Printing Guidelines
I printed all except for the two cog wheels in ASA: all of the body parts (body, torso, face and neck) in natural ASA, the ears and nose in black ASA.  The white eyes were printed in natural ASA and painted gloss white afterwards, the black eyes in black ASA.  The board tray can be printed in any colour.  0.2&nbsp;mm print resolution with 10% in-fill is fine, brims and supports everywhere; these are generally large parts.  I used ASA for UV safety, with which you will likely need glue-stick applied to the heat-bed, but you could equally well use PLA if you were less concerned about UV safety.

For hardness, the two cog wheels were printed in polycarbonate: ASA is bad enough to print with, polycarbonate is even worse but the two cog wheels are quite small so I got away with it.  Likely it is not actually critical to use polycarbonate, if you don't have any then you might use ASA for the cog wheels also.

Be careful when removing the support material, particularly around the back of the upper torso where the cable outlet is quite delicate.  Removing the support material from the sinuous holes behind the eyes is a b\*gger.  The in-fill of the M5-sized-tap holes should be removable without issue but the in-fill in the holes for the 1.5&nbsp;mm brass bar, used for the electrical limit contacts, likely won't come out at all: some post-print drilling will be required.

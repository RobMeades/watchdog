ArtSoft's [Gearotic](https://www.gearotic.com/) was used to generate the two cog wheels that form part of the watchdog.  Not much to see here, but the files kept in case they are useful.

The output `.stl` files are incorporated and modified slightly once imported into the [Blender model](../blender).
